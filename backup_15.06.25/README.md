# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction

A machine learning application that predicts cryptocurrency prices using historical data from Bybit and LSTM neural networks. The application features a Streamlit interface for interactive analysis and real-time predictions.

## Features

- Real-time cryptocurrency price data fetching from Bybit
- Technical indicators calculation (SMA, RSI)
- LSTM-based price prediction model
- Interactive Streamlit web interface
- Historical data visualization
- Trading signals based on predictions

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- Bybit account with API credentials
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd cryptocurrency-price-prediction
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
# On macOS/Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: The project uses specific package versions for compatibility:
- pybit==2.4.1 (Bybit API client)
- streamlit==1.31.0
- tensorflow==2.15.0
- pandas==2.2.0
- numpy==1.26.0

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Bybit API credentials:
```
BYBIT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BYBIT_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
```

To get your API credentials:
1. Log in to your Bybit account
2. Go to Account Settings â†’ API Management
3. Create a new API key pair with "Read-only" permissions (since we only fetch data)
4. Copy the API key and secret to your `.env` file

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

3. In the application:
   - Select a cryptocurrency pair (e.g., BTCUSDT)
   - Choose the historical data period
   - Adjust the trading signal threshold
   - View price predictions and technical indicators

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Streamlit web application interface
- `data_loader.py`: Handles data fetching from Bybit API and preprocessing
- `predictor.py`: LSTM model implementation and training
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
- `.env`: API credentials (not tracked in git)

## Technical Details

- Uses Bybit's v2 API for market data
- Implements 1-hour OHLCV data resampling from trade records
- Features LSTM neural network for time series prediction
- Includes technical indicators:
  - Simple Moving Averages (20 and 50 periods)
  - Relative Strength Index (14 periods)
  - Price change percentage

## Known Limitations

1. API Rate Limits:
   - Bybit API has rate limits that may affect data fetching
   - Large historical data requests may be throttled

2. Data Availability:
   - Some trading pairs may have limited historical data
   - Market data might be delayed during high volatility

3. Prediction Accuracy:
   - The model is for educational purposes only
   - Predictions should not be used for actual trading decisions

## Troubleshooting

1. API Connection Issues:
   - Verify your API credentials in the `.env` file
   - Ensure you're using correct trading pair symbols (e.g., 'BTCUSDT')
   - Check your internet connection
   - If you see "JSON decode error", wait a few minutes and try again (API rate limit)

2. Data Loading Issues:
   - Make sure you have selected a valid date range
   - Verify the trading pair is active on Bybit
   - Check the console for detailed error messages
   - Try reducing the time range if loading large amounts of data

3. Model Training Issues:
   - Ensure sufficient historical data is available (minimum 1000 data points recommended)
   - Check system memory availability
   - Verify data preprocessing steps completed successfully
