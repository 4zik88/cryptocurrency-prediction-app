## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- Bybit account with API credentials
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd cryptocurrency-price-prediction
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
# On macOS/Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: The project uses specific package versions for compatibility:
- pybit==2.4.1 (Bybit API client)
- streamlit==1.31.0
- tensorflow==2.15.0
- pandas==2.2.0
- numpy==1.26.0

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Bybit API credentials:
```
BYBIT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BYBIT_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
```

To get your API credentials:
1. Log in to your Bybit account
2. Go to Account Settings â†’ API Management
3. Create a new API key pair with "Read-only" permissions (since we only fetch data)
4. Copy the API key and secret to your `.env` file

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit application:

**For the enhanced version with futures support:**
```bash
streamlit run app_enhanced.py
```

**For the original spot-only version:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

3. In the application:
   - Select your preferred language (English or Ukrainian) from the sidebar
   - **Choose market type**: Spot Market or Futures Market
   - Select a cryptocurrency pair (e.g., BTCUSDT)
   - Choose the prediction horizon (1 hour to 1 day)
   - Choose the historical data period
   - Adjust the trading signal threshold
   - View price predictions and technical indicators
   - **For futures**: Additional risk metrics and MACD analysis

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Original Streamlit web application (spot markets only)
- `app_enhanced.py`: **Enhanced application with futures support**
- `data_loader.py`: Handles spot market data fetching and preprocessing
- `futures_data_loader.py`: **Futures market data fetching with advanced indicators**
- `predictor.py`: Standard LSTM model for spot markets
- `futures_predictor.py`: **Enhanced LSTM model for futures markets**
- `translations.py`: Multi-language support system
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
- `.env`: API credentials (not tracked in git)

## Technical Details

### Spot Markets
- Uses Bybit's spot API for market data
- Implements 1-hour OHLCV data resampling from trade records
- Features standard LSTM neural network for time series prediction
- Includes basic technical indicators:
  - Simple Moving Averages (20 and 50 periods)
  - Relative Strength Index (14 periods)
  - Price change percentage

### Futures Markets
- Uses Bybit's linear futures API for enhanced market data
- **Enhanced LSTM Architecture**: Multi-layer model with batch normalization and dropout
- **Advanced Technical Indicators**:
  - Simple Moving Averages (SMA 20, 50)
  - Exponential Moving Averages (EMA 12, 26)
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
  - RSI (Relative Strength Index)
  - Bollinger Bands with width calculation
  - ATR (Average True Range) for volatility
  - Volume analysis and ratios
  - High-Low spread analysis
- **Risk Management Features**:
  - Risk/Reward ratio calculation
  - Volatility assessment
  - Directional accuracy measurement
  - Monte Carlo dropout for prediction confidence intervals

## Multi-Language Support

The application supports multiple languages through a centralized translation system:

- **Supported Languages**: English (en) and Ukrainian (uk)
- **Language Switcher**: Available in the sidebar for instant language switching
- **Translation Coverage**: All UI elements, messages, and chart labels are translated
- **Session Persistence**: Language preference is maintained during the session

### Adding New Languages

To add support for additional languages:

1. Open `translations.py`
2. Add a new language code to the `TRANSLATIONS` dictionary
3. Translate all text keys for the new language
4. Update the language selector in `app.py` if needed

Example structure:
```python
TRANSLATIONS = {
    "en": {"key": "English text"},
    "uk": {"key": "Ukrainian text"},
    "new_lang": {"key": "New language text"}
}
```

## Known Limitations

1. API Rate Limits:
   - Bybit API has rate limits that may affect data fetching
   - Large historical data requests may be throttled

2. Data Availability:
   - Some trading pairs may have limited historical data
   - Market data might be delayed during high volatility

3. Prediction Accuracy:
   - The model is for educational purposes only
   - Predictions should not be used for actual trading decisions

## Troubleshooting

1. API Connection Issues:
   - Verify your API credentials in the `.env` file
   - Ensure you're using correct trading pair symbols (e.g., 'BTCUSDT')
   - Check your internet connection
   - If you see "JSON decode error", wait a few minutes and try again (API rate limit)

2. Data Loading Issues:
   - Make sure you have selected a valid date range
   - Verify the trading pair is active on Bybit
   - Check the console for detailed error messages
   - Try reducing the time range if loading large amounts of data

3. Model Training Issues:
   - Ensure sufficient historical data is available (minimum 1000 data points recommended)
   - Check system memory availability
   - Verify data preprocessing steps completed successfully

## Futures Trading Considerations

When using the futures market features, please be aware of additional risks:

- **Leverage Risk**: Futures contracts often involve leverage, amplifying both gains and losses
- **Funding Rates**: Perpetual futures have funding rates that can affect profitability
- **Liquidation Risk**: Leveraged positions can be liquidated if margin requirements aren't met
- **Market Volatility**: Futures markets can be more volatile than spot markets
- **Advanced Indicators**: The additional technical indicators provide more data but require understanding

## Disclaimer
